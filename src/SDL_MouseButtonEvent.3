.SH REMARKS
\fBSDL_MouseButtonEvent\fR is a member of the \fBSDL_Event\fR union and is used when an event of type \fBSDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN\fR or \fBSDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP\fR is reported. You would access it through the event's \fIbutton\fR field.

An \fBSDL_MOUSEBUTTONDOWN\fR or \fBSDL_MOUSEBUTTONUP\fR event occurs whenever a user presses or releases a button on a mouse.

\fBbutton\fR may be on of:

.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab.
SDL_BUTTON_LEFT
SDL_BUTTON_MIDDLE
SDL_BUTTON_RIGHT
SDL_BUTTON_X1
SDL_BUTTON_X2
.TE

.PP
\fBwhich\fR may be \fBSDL_TOUCH_MOUSEID\fR, for events that were generated by a touch input device, and not a real mouse. You might want to ignore such events, if your application already handles \fBSDL_TouchFingerEvent\fR.
