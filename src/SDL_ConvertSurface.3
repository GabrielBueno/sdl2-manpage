.SH NAME
\fBSDL_ConvertSurface\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to copy an existing surface into a new one that is optimized for blitting to a surface of a specified pixel format.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
SDL_Surface SDL_ConvertSurface(SDL_Surface*   src,
                               const          SDL_PixelFormat* fmt,
                               Uint32         flags)

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab l.
src:the existing \fBSDL_Surface\fR structure to convert
fmt:the \fBSDL_PixelFormat\fR structure that the new surface is optimized for
flags:the flags are unused and should be set to 0; this is a leftover from SDL 1.2's API
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the new \fBSDL_Surface\fR structure that is created or NULL if it fails; call \fBSDL_GetError()\fR for more information.

.SH REMARKS
This function is used to optimize images for faster repeat blitting. This is accomplished by converting the original and storing the result as a new surface. The new, optimized surface can then be used as the source for future blits, making them faster.
