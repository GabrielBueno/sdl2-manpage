                            int*        w,
                            int*        h)

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TS
tab(:) allbox;

.SH REMARKS
This may differ from \fBSDL_GetWindowSize()\fR if we're rendering to a high-DPI drawable, i.e. the window was created with \fBSDL_WINDOW_ALLOW_HIGHDPI\fR on a platform with high-DPI support (Apple calls this "Retina"), and not disabled by the \fBSDL_HINT_VIDEO_HIGHDPI_DISABLED\fR hint.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.1.
