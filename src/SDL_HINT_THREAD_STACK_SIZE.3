.SH NAME
\fBSDL_HINT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE\fR -- Hints

.SH Synopsis
A hint that specifies a variable specifying SDL's threads stack size in bytes or "0" for the backend's default size.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Values
.TP 5
.BI 0
use the backend's default threads stack size
.TP
.BI X
use the provided positive threads stack size

.SH DEFAULT
By default the backend's default threads stack size is used.

.SH REMARKS
Use this hint in case you need to set SDL's threads stack size to other than the default. This is specially useful if you build SDL against a non glibc libc library (such as musl) which provides a relatively small default thread stack size (a few kilobytes versus the default 8 MB glibc uses).
.PP
Support for this hint is currently available only in the pthread, Windows (>= SDL 2.0.5), and PSP (>= SDL 2.0.5) backend.

.SH VERSION
Available since SDL 2.0.4

.SH NOTE
Draft
