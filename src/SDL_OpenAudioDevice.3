.SH NAME
\fBSDL_OpenAudioDevice\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to open a specific audio device.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;

T{
.nf
SDL_AudioDeviceID SDL_OpenAudioDevice(const char*             device,
                                      int                     iscapture,
                                      const SDL_AudioSpec*    desired,
                                      SDL_AudioSpec*          obtained,

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab l.
device:T{
a UTF-8 string reported by \fBSDL_GetAudioDeviceName()\fR; see \fIRemarks\fR
T}
iscapture:T{
non-zero to sepcify a device should be opened for recording, not playback
T}
desired:T{
an \fBSDL_AudioSpec\fR structure representing the desired output format; see \fBSDL_OpenAudio()\fR for more information
T}
obtained:T{
an \fBSDL_AudioSpec\fR structure filled in with the actual output format; see \fBSDL_OpenAudio()\fR for more information
T}
allowed_changes:T{
0, or one or more flags OR'd together; see \fIRemarks\fR for details
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a valid device ID that is > 0 on success or 0 on failure; call \fBSDL_GetError()\fR for more information.

For compabitility with SDL 1.2, this will never return 1, since SDL reserves that ID for the legacy \fBSDL_OpenAudio()\fR function.

.SH CODE EXAMPLES
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
SDL_AudioSpec want, have;
SDL_AudioDeviceID dev;

SDL_memset(&want, 0, sizeof(want));   /* or SDL_zero(want) */
want.freq = 48000;
want.format = AUDIO_F32;
want.channels = 2;
want.samples = 4096;
want.callback = MyAudioCallback;  /* you wrote this function elsewhere -- see SDL_AudioSpec for details */

dev = SDL_OpenAudioDevice(NULL, 0, &want, &have, SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGES);
if (dev == 0)
{
  SDL_Log("Failed to open audio: %s", SDL_GetError());
}
else
{
  if (have.format != want.format) /* we let this one thing change */
  {
    SDL_Log("We didn't get Float32 audio format.");
  }
  SDL_PauseAudio(0);  /*  start audio playing. */
  SDL_Delay(5000);    /*  let the audio callback play some sound for 5 seconds */
  SDL_CloseAudio();
}
.fi

.SH REMARKS
\fBSDL_OpenAudio()\fR, unlike this fuction, always acts on device ID 1. As such, this function will never return a 1 so as not to conflict with the legacy function.

Please note that SDL 2.0 before 2.0.5 did not support recording; as such, this function was failing if \fBiscapture\fR was not zero. Starting with SDL 2.0.5 recording is implemented and this value can be non-zero.

Passing in a \fBdevice\fR name of NULL requests the most reasonable default (and is equivalent to what \fBSDL_OpenAudio()\fR does to choose a device). The \fBdevice\fR name is a UTF-8 string reported by \fBSDL_GetAudioDeviceName()\fR, but some drivers allow arbitrary and driver-specific strings, such as a hostname/IP address for a remote audio server, or a filename in the diskaudio driver.

\fBallowed_changes\fR can have the following flags OR'd together:

.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab.
SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FREQUENCY_CHANGE
SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE
SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_CHANNELS_CHANGE
SDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_ANY_CHANGE
.TE

These flags specify how SDL should behave when a device cannot offer a specific feature. If the application requests a feature that the hardware doesn't offer, SDL will always try to get the closest equivalent.

For example, if you ask for float32 audio format, but the sound card only supports int16, SDL will set the hardware to int16. If you had set \fBSDL_AUDIO_ALLOW_FORMAT_CHANGE\fR, SDL will change the format in the \fBobtained\fR structure. If that flag was not set, SDL will prepare to convert your callback's float32 audio to int16 before feeding it to the hardware and will keep the originally requested format in the \fBobtained\fR structure.

If your application can only handle one specific data format, pass a zero for \fBallowed_changes\fR and let SDL transparently handle any differences.

An opened audio device starts out paused, and should be enabled for playing by calling \fBSDL_PauseAudioDevice(devid, 0)\fR when you are ready for your audio callback function to be called. Since the audio driver may modify the requested size of the audio buffer, you should allocate any local mixing buffers after you open the audio device.

The audio callback runs in a separate thread in most cases; you can prevent race conditions between your callback and other threads without fully pausing playback with \fBSDL_LockAudioDevice()\fR. For more information about the callback, see \fBSDL_AudioSpec\fR.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
