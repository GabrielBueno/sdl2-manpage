do not load any library, useful if you compiled ANGLE from source and included the compiler in your binaries.

.SH DEFAULT
By default "d3dcompiler_46.dll" will be used.

.SH REMARKS
SDL has EGL and OpenGL ES2 support on Windows via the ANGLE project. It can use different sets of binaries, those compiled by the user from source or those provided by the Chrome browser. In the later case, these binaries require that SDL loads a DLL providing the shader compiler.

.SH VERSION
Available since SDL 2.0.2
