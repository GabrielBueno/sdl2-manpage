SDL_Haptic* SDL_HapticOpenFromJoystick(SDL_Joystick*    joystick)

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a valid haptic device identifier on success or NULL on failure; call \fBSDL_GetError()\fR for more information.

.SH REMARKS
You must still close the haptic device separately. It will not be closed with the joystick.

When opened from a joystick you should first close the haptic device before closing the joystick device. If not, on some implementations the haptic device will also get unallocated and you'll be unable to use force feedback on that device.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
