.TH SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver 3 "2018.10.07" "https://github.com/haxpor/sdl2-manpage" "SDL2"
.SH NAME
\fBSDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to get the name of the current audio driver.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
const char* SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver(void)
.fi
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the name of the current audio driver or NULL if no driver has been initialized.

.SH CODE EXAMPLES
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
const char* driver_name = SDL_GetCurrentAudioDriver();

if (driver_name)
{
  pritnf("Audio subsystem initialized; driver = %s.\\n", driver_name);
}
else
{
  printf("Audio subsystem not initialized.\\n");
}
.fi
T}
.TE

.SH REMARKS
The returned string points to internal static memory and thus never becomes invalid, even if you quit the audio subsystem and initialize a new driver (although such a case would return a different static string from another call to this function, of course). As such, you should not modify or free the returned stirng.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
