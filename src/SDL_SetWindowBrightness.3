.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call \fBSDL_GetError()\fR for more information.

.SH REMARKS
Despite the name and signature, this method sets the brightness of the entire display, not an individual window. A window is considered to be owned by the display that contains the window's center pixel. (The index of this display can be retrieved using \fBSDL_GetWindowDisplayIndex()\fR.) The brightness set will not follow the window if it is moved to anothe display.
