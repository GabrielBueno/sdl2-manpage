.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS

pointer which is filled with the "userdata" pointer that was passed to \fBSDL_SetAssertionHandler()\fR; see \fRRemarks\fR for details.
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the \fBSDL_AssertionHandler\fR that is called when an assert triggers.

.SH REMARKS
This returns the function pointer that is called when an assertion is trigggered. This is either the value last passed to \fBSDL_SetAssertionHandler()\fR, or if no application-specified function is set, is equivalent to calling \fBSDL_GetDefaultAssertionHandler()\fR.

The parameter \fBpuserdata\fR is a pointer to a void*, which will store the "userdata" pointer that was passed to \fBSDL_SetAssertionHandler()\fR. This value will always be NULL for the default handler. If you dont' care about this data, it is safe to pass a NULL pointer to this function to ignore it.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.2.
