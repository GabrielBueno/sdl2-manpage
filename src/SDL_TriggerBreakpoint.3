.SH REMARKS
If the program is running under a debugger, this function will trigger a breakpoint. It is typically used temporarily during debugging or with other error handling. Note that if a debugger isn't running, on some platforms this can terminate your application.

This isn't actually a function, but rather a macro. The intention is that the debugger will stop on exactly this line of code instead of somewhere inside the SDL library. As such, \fIthe assertion facility\fR (\fIhttps://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryAssertions\fR) uses this so that the debugger stops on the exact line of code where an \fBSDL_assert\fR failed.
