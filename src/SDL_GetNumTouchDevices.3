.SH NAME
\fBSDL_GetNumTouchDevices\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to get the number of registered touch devices.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
int SDL_GetNumTouchDevices(void)
.fi
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of registered touch devices.

.SH REMARKS
On some platforms SDL first sees the touch device if it was actually used. Therefore \fBSDL_GetNumTouchDevices()\fR may return 0 although devices are available. After using all devices at least once the number will be correct.

This was fixed for Android in SDL 2.0.1.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.0.
