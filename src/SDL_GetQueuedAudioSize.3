.TH SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize 3 "2018.10.07" "https://github.com/haxpor/sdl2-manpage" "SDL2"
.SH NAME
\fBSDL_GetQueuedAudioSize\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to get the number of bytes of still-queued audio.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
Uint32 SDL_GetQueuedAudioSize(SDL_AudioDeviceID dev)
.fi
T}
.TE

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab l.
dev:T{
the device ID of which we will query queued audio size
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of bytes (not samples!) of queued audio.

.SH REMARKS
This is the number of bytes that have been queued for playback with \fBSDL_QueueAudio()\fR, but have not yet been sent to the hardware.

Once we've sent it to the hardware, this function can nod decide the exact byte boundary of what has been played. It's possible that we just gave the hardware several kilobytes right before you called this function, but it hasn't played any of it yet, or maybe half of it, etc.

You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied callback; calling this function on such a device always returns 0. You have to use the audio callback or queue audio with \fBSDL_QueueAudio()\fR, but not both.

You should not call \fBSDL_LockAudio()\fR on the device before querying; SDL handles locking internally for this function.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.4.
