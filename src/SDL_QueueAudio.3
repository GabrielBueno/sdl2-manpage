.SH NAME
\fBSDL_QueueAudio\fR -- Function

.SH SYNOPSIS
Use this function to queue more audio on non-callback devices.

.SH SYNTAX
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
a.
T{
.nf
int SDL_QueueAudio(SDL_AudioDeviceID    dev,
                   const void*          data,
                   Uint32               len)
.fi
T}

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TS
tab(:) allbox;
ab l.
dev:T{
the device ID to which we will queue audio
T}
data:T{
the data to queue to the device for later playback
T}
len:T{
the number of bytes (not samples!) to which (data) points to
T}
.TE

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure; call \fBSDL_GetError()\fR for more information.

.SH REMARKS
If you are looking to retrieve queued audio from a non-callback capture device, you want \fBSDL_DequeueAudio()\fR instead. \fBSDL_QueueAudio()\fR will return -1 to signify an error if you use it with capture devices.

SDL offers two ways to feed audio to the device: you can either supply a callback that SDL triggers with some frequency to obtain more audio (pull method), or you can supply no callback, and then SDL will expect you to supply data at regular intervals (push method) with this function.

There are no limits on the amount of data you can queue, short of exhaustion of address space. Queued data will drain to the device as necessary without further intervention from you. If the device needs audio but there is not enough queued, it will play silence to make up the difference. This means you will have skips in your audio playback if you aren't routinely queueing sufficient data.

This function copies the supplied data, so you are safe to free it when the function returns. This function is thread-safe, but queueing to the same device from two threads at once does not promise which buffer will be queued first.

You may not queue audio on a device that is using an application-supplied callback; doing so returns an error. You have to use the audio callback or queue audio with this function, but not both.

You should not call \fBSDL_LockAudio()\fR on the device before queueing; SDL handles locking internally for this function.

.SH VERSION
This function is available since SDL 2.0.4.
